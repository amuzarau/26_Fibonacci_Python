Fibonacci sequence, a famous mathematical pattern. My educational project from Al Sweigart book “The Big Book of Small Python Projects”

The Fibonacci sequence is a famous mathematical pattern credited to Italian mathematician Fibonacci in the 13th century (though others had discovered it even earlier). 
The sequence begins with 0 and 1, and the next number is always the sum of the previous two numbers. 
The sequence continues forever: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, 233, 377, 610, 987 . . .

The Fibonacci sequence has applications in music composition, stock market prediction, the pattern of florets in the head of sunflowers, and 
many other areas. This program lets you calculate the sequence as high as you are willing to go.
